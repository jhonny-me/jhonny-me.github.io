## About

My name is Jhonny Copper, a self taught iOS/OS X and Web Developer in China. I'm currently part of a small iOS team at YCode, working as a code farmer. We are now trying to establish a code standard to make our team work more effective. Me myself is trying to find a inner peace to learn and code without disturbance.
